# HTML Injection

- P3 or P4 as it is a client side vulnerability.
- Well as the name suggests, HTML injection occurs when the page reflects to any HTML modifications.
- Lets say changing the tags etc etc.
- It is a client side attack.
- The tags which are generally used are :
	- h1
	- h2
	- h3
	- br
	- img
- It is mainly of two types:
	- **GET BASED**
		- Getting any information through the server.
		- Example : Search Bar
	- **POST BASED**
		- In post request we send data to the server .
		- Example : Login Page, Sign In page
- Thus we can easily get 50-100$ for this bug.
- This vulnerability can be found overly anywhere where the text is being reflected.
